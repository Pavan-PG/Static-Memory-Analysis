#### Static-Memory-Analysis   

Static Analysis describes the process of analysing the code or structure of a program to determine
its function. It employs different tools and techniques to quickly determine whether a file is
Malicious or not, provide information about its functionality.   

In the project I will be using the following techniques in static analysis of a malware   

1. Using antivirus tools to confirm maliciousness   
2. Gleaning information from a fileâ€™s strings, functions and headers.   

Please refer the report of performed analysis.
